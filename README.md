# Assignment 3: Concurrent Java Application

## Introduction
In this assignment, you will develop and test a concurrent Java application using the Active Object and Future patterns to compute the Flesch-Kincaid grade level score for each play written by William Shakespeare.

## Learning Outcomes
- 👩‍💻 Use IntelliJ IDE for Java programming and unit testing.
- 🚀 Program with Java's functional features (lambda expressions, method references, functional interfaces).
- 🔄 Develop a concurrent Java application applying Active Object and Future patterns.
- 📚 Reuse the Array class from Assignment 1 and the FleschKincaidGradeLevelCalculator class from Assignment 2.
